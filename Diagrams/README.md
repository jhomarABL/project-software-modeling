# UML Diagrams and CRC Cards

This folder contains the following diagrams and CRC cards that represent the system’s structure and behavior:

## Contents

1. **Sequence Diagram**  
   Represents how objects interact over time, showing the exchange of messages between them to perform a specific function within the system.

2. **Activity Diagram**  
   Breaks down the workflow or activities of a process, describing the sequential steps and the decisions involved.

3. **Class Diagram**  
   Displays the static structure of the system, detailing the classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them (such as inheritance, association, and aggregation).  
   You can view the class diagram in the file: [class diagram.jpg](./class%20diagram.jpg)

4. **Deployment Diagram**  
   Describes the physical distribution of the system, specifying the nodes and artifacts that make up the hardware and software infrastructure.

5. **CRC Cards (Class, Responsibility, and Collaborators)**  
   These cards are used to model the behavior and interactions of classes, clearly defining each class’s responsibilities and which other classes it collaborates with.

**Note:** These diagrams are under continuous development and may be updated as the system evolves.
